  body: Return the type translator employed by this database instance. Each database instance has its own type translator; this allows for different type handlers to be installed in each instance without affecting other instances. Furthermore, the translators are instantiated lazily, so that if a database does not use type translation, it will not be burdened by the overhead of a useless type translator. (See the Translator class.)
