- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Executes all SQL statements in the given string. By contrast, the other means of executing queries will only execute the first statement in the string, ignoring all subsequent statements. This will execute each one in turn. The same bind parameters, if given, will be applied to each statement.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This always returns <tt>nil</tt>, making it unsuitable for queries that return rows.
