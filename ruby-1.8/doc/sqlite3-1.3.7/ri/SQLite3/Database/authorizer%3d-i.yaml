- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Installs (or removes) a block that will be invoked for every access to the database. If the block returns 0 (or <tt>true</tt>), the statement is allowed to proceed. Returning 1 or false causes an authorization error to occur, and returning 2 or nil causes the access to be silently denied.
